# What is a simple key?

- A key that consists of one column (Ex. `Username`)

# What is a composite key?

- A key that consists of two or more columns (Ex. `FirstName` + `LastName` + `Email`)
- At least one column is **not** a primary/foreign key

# What is a compound key?

*Note: this term is sometimes used interchangeably with the term 'composite key'. Always analyze the context which the term 'compound key' appears in before deciding its meaning.*
- Like the composite key, this is a key that is composed of two or more columns. However, unlike the composite key, all columns must be keys (primary/foreign) themselves.
